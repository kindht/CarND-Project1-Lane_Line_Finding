This is the 1st project in Term1 for the **Self-Driving Car Engineer** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer--nd013)

The project used **Python** and **OpenCV** (Open-Source Computer Vision) to detect lane lines in images and videos. 

The useful tools used in the project including:
 - Color selection 
 - Region of interest selection
 - Grayscaling
 - Gaussian smoothing, 
 - Canny Edge Detection 
 - Hough Tranform line detection
